subtitle: Some things to remember when taking part in the community
---

Every visitor to Rainbow Materia has a right to be safe, welcomed, and comfortable -- regardless of their personal identity or circumstances.

Like all communities, Rainbow Materia has a set of guidelines that we ask all of our visitors to follow at all times, in order to keep the atmosphere healthy and to allow for a variety of voices and viewpoints.

These guidelines apply at all times, on all Rainbow Materia platforms -- including our Discord, these forums, and when interacting with us elsewhere on the internet.

## Be Excellent to Each Other

This rule covers quite a few different things, so let's break it down:

### No Flaming

Rainbow Materia is an open and positive community. Any sort of abusive, belittling, or actively harmful language -- known as flaming for short -- is strictly forbidden, and you are required to be respectful of others at all times, even if you disagree with them.

### We Welcome Everyone

Please remember that Rainbow Materia is an LGBTQIA+ community first and foremost, but we also welcome allies with open arms.

What this means in practice is that we're not a place for bashing people outside the community, and our goal will always be to build a safe, tolerant space for anyone who needs one. While we fully understand the need to blow off steam and vent about larger society, please refrain from attacking (for example) _all_ straight people, or _all_ cisgender people.

### Follow Internet Etiquette

We expect basic etiquette to be followed -- for example:

1. Don't harass, grief, or troll people. This includes not engaging in logical fallacies, bad-faith debating (such as sealioning[^1]), or otherwise deliberately provoking arguments.
2. Don't pretend to be anyone else, or impersonate a member of staff.
3. Don't mini-mod (that is, trying to punish rule-breaking on behalf of the staff). While _politely_ reminding others of the rules is perfectly acceptable, trying to take matters into your own hands counts as flaming. Report it to the staff and let them handle it instead.
4. Don't expose or divulge anyone's private information (sometimes known as doxxing).

### Debate In Good Faith

While the community is often home to meaningful and serious debates, we expect everyone to be deliberate in how they approach them. While we welcome disagreements and differing opinions, be sure to criticise the ideas being put forward, rather than attacking the people making them.

### Look After Each Other

Each of us have our own issuese that we struggle with, and it's important that we acknowledge that and work to allow everyone to feel comfortable. We ask that you do your best to be respectful of this. A few things that can help are:

1. If you are asked to move a triggering discussion to the support channels, please do so where possible.
2. When posting something that may trigger or upset others, consider posting in a spoiler tag, marked with a content warning.
3. Consider the lived experiences of those around you, particularly by those whose experiences don't match yours. What may not upset you could be a harmful trigger to others, so take care when speaking about sensitive topics.

## No Hate Speech or Support

Our goal will always be to build a safe, tolerant space for anyone who needs one. That said, we are well aware that tolerance is a two-way street. Our tolerance and kindness only extends to those willing to show us - and the entire Rainbow Materia community - that same tolerance and kindness.

This means that hate speech is strictly banned in all forms, and may result in instant removal from the community without warning. This includes (but is not limited to):

- Sexism
- Racism
- Homophobia
- Transphobia
- Identity erasure (a refusal to acknowledge the validity of bi, trans, intersex, nonbinary identifications, etcetera)
- Racial or cultural supremacy
- Slut-shaming
- Religious discrimination (Islamophobia, antisemitism, etcetera)

Please note that support for organisations, political parties or governments that support hateful views is also banned.

## Posts Must Be Safe for Work

This is a SFW (safe for work) community, and as such everything here should be suitable for those aged under 18.

This means strictly no discussion or imagery of genitals or sexual acts, and no solicitation of other members. While we generally allow double entendres and puns, please remember to moderate your use of them - the odd comment is fine, but we don't want to be turning the air blue with filthy humour.

Most of our interpretation of what is and isn't safe for work follows Western cultural standards, but please be aware of the following notes:

- We do not believe that depictions of nipples are inherently sexual, and as such allow them to be posted in a non-sexual context regardless of gender presentation. However, they must be posted under spoiler tags at all times, as they are unsuitable for certain environments such as work or school.
- Discussion (but not imagery) of sexual health topics such as transgender surgery is allowed. However, for the comfort of those who may be uncomfortable reading about such issues, please use the relevant Support channel for these topics.
- Content containing abusive or demeaning acts are strictly banned.

As what is and is not acceptable under this rule may be open to interpretation, please contact staff if you have any questions about whether something is or is not allowed.

## No Illegal Content

It should go without saying, but please donâ€™t post anything illegal, such as pirated content -- such as games, video, ROMs of copyrighted content, and so on -- or provide instructions on how to find such content.

Please note that this includes fansubbed anime and scanlated manga.

## Post Art With Credit

When posting art or other creative content, please be sure to credit the original source. This can be done as easily as linking to where you found the content, or including the artist's name alongside the content. This is so that work posted here is respectful to the original artist, proper credit is given to them, and so that we have an easy way to verify that the image is suitable for reposting.

Please note that memes are generally exempt from this rule due to their nature, as they take on a life of their own and are difficult to trace back to an original creator.

## A Note on Politics

It is no secret that almost all LGBTQIA+ people have their lives politicised at every turn, and as a result, one of the main goals of Rainbow Materia is to offer a sanctuary where visitors are invited to be themselves, without having to explain or justify their own existence.

As such, we ask that topics of a political nature are handled with sensitivity and tact at all times. While this doesn't mean that you're not allowed to discuss politics at all, it does mean that such discussions be taken with kindness, respect, and tolerance for those around you.

As many in our community have been directly harmed by toxic politics, please do not attempt to start political or ideological debates anywhere on Rainbow Materia.

## Don't Abuse Community Functionality

Please do not abuse functionality provided by the forums, Discord, or our Discord bots. This includes:

- Attempting to tag `@everyone` or `@here` either directly or via a bot
- Mass-mentioning (mentioning many people in a short space of time, or repeatedly pinging someone)
- Spamming or flooding (posting the same thing repeatedly)
- Gaming the system for likes, badges, and so on

## The Good Faith Doctrine

These guidelines should be taken as an indication for how to act here at Rainbow Materia, not as commandments cast in stone. Please treat everyone else here as if they are working in good faith, and be sure to act in good faith yourself in return.

As part of this, we may sometimes need to issue warnings for behaviour that does not fit the spirit of the community, even if it's technically within the letter of the guidelines. We will only do this in cases where the community is actively being harmed.

As part of our expectation that you act in good faith, we ask that you do not try to manipulate these guidelines to justify doing something that should reasonably not be allowed, or try to argue semantics to get out of punishments for breaking the rules.

## Discord Community Guidelines

Please note that our Discord server, like all other Discord servers, follows the Discord Community Guidelines. We reserve the right to submit reports to Discord if necessary. You can [click here to
read the Discord Community Guidelines](https://discordapp.com/guidelines).

## Guideline Changes and Updates

These guidelines may be updated at any time, including if an omission or loophole is discovered. These changes may happen for a number of reasons, and are often to clarify the enforcement of a particular section, or to address issues that may not have come up before.

Whenever we update the guidelines, we will post an announcement describing the changes, and will keep a log of updates to this document accessible at all times.

Please note that by using Rainbow Materia, you agree to follow the latest version of these guidelines

## Contacting Staff

If you have any questions about these rules, or want clarification on how we would enforce them in any given situation, please reach out to a member of staff and we will be happy to help.

You can also contact us t There are a few ways to contact us if you need to.

### Feo Ul/Modmail

#Our primary means of contact us via `@Feo Ul#2288` on Discord. Feo Ul is our modmail bot, which means that DMs sent to them will be opened as tickets that anyone on the staff team can review and respond to.

This means you'll get a quicker response, as any appropriate staff member can respond and discuss your issue with you, without needing you to guess who's available to help.

If you would prefer to be assisted by someone with particular experience, please specify in your message and we will honour your request if at all possible.

### Discord or Forum DMs

If you'd like to contact a member of staff directly, you can DM us either on these forums or via Discord. You might choose to do this if you wish to speak to someone in particular, or if your issue is sensitive. Please note that contacting a staff member directly may mean that you take longer to receive a reply.

## Warnings, Bans, and Appeals

Rainbow Materia's staff team are responsible for monitoring the community and, if necessary, enforcing the guidelines listed here. However, our job is not to punish every little transgression, but instead to guide and educate our users. This means we prefer to talk to people rather than punishing them; to guide rather than rebuke.

That said, our first priority is the safety of the community, and we will take whatever actions are needed to ensure that everyone in the community can be safe, comfortable, and accepted. To guide this, we follow a broad structure for issuing warnings and bans, which allows us to maintain consistency and transparency in terms of how we enforce the guidelines, but still allows us the flexibility to adapt our approach when needed.

#If you have any comments or concerns, please contact `@Feo Ul#2288` to send a message to the staff team, and we'll get back to you promptly.

### Warning Types

If you run afoul of the rules here at Rainbow Materia, one of three things will happen:

### Verbal Warning

A member of staff will contact you and discuss what went wrong and how it can be improved. Verbal warnings don't count as strikes against you, and are mostly used to inform you when there's room for improvement in how you interact with the community.

### Written Warning

Written warnings are issued through Mitsuha, our bot, and are kept on record and can be viewed by the staff team. While written warnings technically don't expire, old warnings are unlikely to be counted against you if significant time has passed and we've seen your behaviour improve.

Like verbal warnings, a member of staff will contact you and explain why you're receiving a warning, and you will also receive a DM from Mitsuha when the warning is issued.

### Immediate Ban

Immediate bans - where a user is immediately removed from the entire community - are considered a nuclear option. We will only ever immediately ban established members in extreme circumstances where it is impossible to resolve the issue using the normal methods. We list this here largely for completeness, as it is very, very unlikely that this scenario will see much use.

We do, however, immediately ban very new users who are overtly abusive or disruptive in order to protect the community, as it is unlikely that they will put the effort in to change their behaviour.

## Strikes and Bans

We believe that effective moderation can't be done properly with strict, inflexible systems, so we don't operate a formal strike system.

However, as a rule of thumb, we will generally consider issuing a ban if a user gains three written warnings without improving their behaviour. All bans are discussed with the staff team before they are implemented, in order to maintain accountability and verify the facts before acting.

## Appeals

Any written warning or ban can be appealed by contacting `@Feo Ul#2288` on Discord. Appeals are reviewed by a different staff member than the one who issued the warning, and will be assessed independently. If a warning or ban was issued in error, it will be removed from the system, and will no longer count against you.
